Well, who doubts it?
I doubt it,

I will not, señor,

It is easy to see,

Hush, friend Sancho,

Be that as God will,
That is the truth,
If so,
Most certainly, señor,
That I grant,
I will do so, I promise you,
This will be worse than the windmills,

Señor,
Thou art wrong there,
Enough,
I have already told thee, Sancho,
I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,

There is nothing wonderful in that,

Thou mayest well believe that,
but this
I swear it,
I say so,
I say,
Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,
It is not for that,
At any rate,
Not for me either,
Then thou hast been thrashed too?
Didn’t I say so? worse luck to my line!
Be not distressed, friend,
It cannot be the Moor,
If they don’t let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,
if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.
Mine could speak too,
Well, how goes it, good man?
I would speak more politely if I were you,
That is the truth,
If your worship knew that,
“woe betide me and all my
why did you let me taste it?”
Then this is an inn?
And a very respectable one,
I have been under a mistake all this time,
I have little to do with that,
You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,
I would have avenged myself too if I could,
How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,
Very likely,
That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,
Such is my luck,
Fear not that, Sancho,
According to that there must be two,
What?
But why are these two lords such enemies?
They are at enmity,
By my beard,
In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,
That I can well understand,
That is true,
How canst thou say that!
I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,
The fear thou art in, Sancho,
Holy Mary!
so loyal and well-behaved was he
How have I not?
What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?
Yes, they are missing,
In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,
It would be so,
For all that,
Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,
Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,
Well, be it as your worship says,
Ask that of God, my son,
Four,
Mind what you are saying, señor.
I say four, if not five,
Well, then,
Luckless that I am!
for the pain in Don Quixote’s jaws kept him uneasy and
Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him
Thou art very right, Sancho,
Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?
It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,
In that case,
Unlucky me!
Be they phantoms ever so much,
And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,
what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?
For all that,
I will, please God,
for they could perceive plainly
We are in haste,
Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?
What, señor?
My bad luck.
Then still worse awaits you,
You shall be soon satisfied,
And who killed him?
God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,
In that case,
I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,
Things do not all happen in the same way,
As my fate has so willed it,
I would have talked on till to-morrow,
I do not understand that Latin,
Knight of the Rueful Countenance
I will tell you,
It is not that,
How canst thou see, Sancho,
That’s true,
Let it want what it may,
There is no need to weep,
What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?
Be not angry, master mine,
Still,

Go on with thy story, Sancho,
I say then,

If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,
Tell it as thou wilt,
And so, lord of my soul,
Then you knew her?
I did not know her,
That is the natural way of women,
It came to pass,
let your worship keep count of the goats the
Take it for granted he brought them all across,
How many have gone across so far?
How the devil do I know?
There it is,
How can that be?
No, señor, not a bit,
So, then,
the story has come to an end?
As much as my mother has,
In truth,
All that may be,
Let it end where it will, well and good,
What noise is that, Sancho?
I don’t know, señor,
Sancho, it strikes me thou art in great fear.
I am,
Very likely,
Then go back three or four, my friend,
I’ll bet,
It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,
for as to
Well, then, if you are joking I am not,
No more of that, señor,
at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see
I do not deny,
At any rate,
It may be on the dice,
All that your worship says is very well,
I do not believe,
That is true,
By so doing,
Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,
The devil take thee, man,
I don’t know,
How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?
What I see and make out,
Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,
I will take care to stand aside,
and I say no more
What art thou laughing at, Sancho?
I am laughing,
Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?
That is,
It does not grieve me much to have lost it,
So have I,
Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,
I have never been in the habit,
God knows I should like to take it,
On that head I am not quite certain,
So urgent is it,
Say, on, Sancho,
Well then, señor,
Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,
or the Serpent, or any other title under which he
That’s what I want, and no mistake about it!
Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,
It comes to this, too,
Nobody can object to that,
Then since that may be,
God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,
and mean be he who thinks himself mean.
In God’s name let him be so,
And more than enough for thee,
Not a doubt of it; and I’ll know how to support the tittle,
Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,
So be it,
Thou wilt look well,
What more will it be,
Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?
I will tell you,
Thou art right,
Let the barber business be my look-out,
So it shall be,
How by force?
I do not say that,
In fact,
Just so,
Then if so,
Recollect, your worship,
Nevertheless,
For that only?
The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,
What are gurapas?
Gurapas are galleys,

Yes, sir,

They do,

So good is it,
And how is the book entitled?
The ‘Life of Gines de Pasamonte,’
And is it finished?
How can it be finished,

You seem a clever fellow,
And an unfortunate one,

I told you already to go gently, master commissary,

Nice nonsense!
’Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,
That is all very well,
Then by all that’s good,
Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,
Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho,
Señor,
and it is impossible it can be otherwise
That cannot be,
Thou art right,
There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,
What clue is there?
I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it,
I only said Chloe,
Then your worship understands rhyming too?
And better than thou thinkest,
Read more, your worship,
A correspondence letter, señor?
From the beginning it seems to be a love letter,
Then let your worship read it aloud,

And is it very perilous, this achievement?
No,
On my diligence!
Yes,
I am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone,
What is it in reality,
Have I not told thee,
It seems to me,
There is the point,
Look here, Sancho,
I declare, Sancho,
But what more have I to see besides what I have seen?
Much thou knowest about it!
For the love of God,
as the whole thing is feigned, and
you might be content, I say, with giving them
I thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,
It was worse losing the ass,
Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?
For one who is in hell,
I do not understand what _retentio_ means,
_Retentio_,
That is true,
And the ass-colt order too,
All shall be included,
But what is to be done about the signature?
The letters of Amadis were never signed,
That is all very well,
The order shall go signed in the same book,
So, so!
She it is,
I know her well,
I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,
I say that your worship is entirely right,

There is no need to sign it,

It cannot have said ‘scrubbing,’
That is it,

But for that,

She is called the Princess Micomicona,
There’s no doubt of that,
So it may,
I will not answer a word, beauteous lady,
I will not rise, señor,
I grant and accord it,
Let her be who she may,
Then what I ask,
I repeat that I grant it,
Let us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady.
On no account will I allow it,
Nor even that will I consent to, señor licentiate,
It will, I am sure,
That he is,
And so it is,
Yes,
Yes, señor, my way lies towards that kingdom.
In that case,
Your worship is mistaken, señor,
Enough; no more praise,
I will answer that briefly,
pointing to Cardenio
These, then,
Blockhead!
That I swear heartily,
I will hold my peace, señora,
That I will do with all my heart,
It will not be wearisome, señora,
Well, if that be so, give me your attention.
First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is—
That is the truth,
for it is
that he
‘Don Quixote,’ he must have said, señora,
otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.
That is it,
What does your worship want to strip for?
To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,
There is no occasion to strip,
That is enough,
But how did you land at Osuna, señora,
That is what I meant to say,
And that would be only natural,
There is no more to add,
What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?
On my oath it is so,
This, sirs,
They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,
I will

Do you think,
How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!
hast thou not just now brought me a message from her?
I mean,
Now I forgive thee,
That I see,
For all that, Sancho,
I need say no more to
Well, well,
That is enough,
Let your worship ask what you will,
Why dost thou say that, Sancho?
I say it,
though there is nothing of that about
merely as something belonging to your worship.”
Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,
So I saw,
So it is,
But another strange thing about it,
Señor,
It is as thou sayest,
So I should have done,
And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?
No, señor,
All that is not unsatisfactory to me,
I did not,
Then depend upon it,
It was neither, but red,
Then I promise thee,
When I went to give it to her,
Discreet lady!
She asked me nothing,
In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,
And so lofty she is,
What! Sancho,
didst thou measure with her?
I measured in this way,
Well!
All I can say is,
It could not be that,
Maybe so,
Well then,
As for the letter,
So far all goes well,
That is very likely,
She is generous in the extreme,
That must have been it,
Quicksilver!
Ah! what a sad state your worship’s brains are in!
Look here, Sancho,
That is plain speaking,
I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,
Well then, if that be so,
O, how silly and simple thou art!
It is with that kind of love,
The devil take thee for a clown!
In faith, then, I cannot even read.
All that your worship has said is quite true,
How! the opposite?
Not only did he not pay me,
The mischief,
That is true,
but it was of no use.
Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,
That is true,
I have no faith in those oaths,
Why, what share have you got?
This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,
And I just as much,
That is true,
And you, what do you think, young lady?
I don’t know indeed, señor,
Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?
I don’t know what I should do,
Hush, child,
As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,
Well then,

No, indeed,
That may well be,

Leave it to me to find out that,
Still,
I have told you already,
And how was the captain called, señor?
He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,
We are listening to it already, señor,
What art thou talking about, child?
Nay, he is the lord of many places,
Let him, in Heaven’s name,
impossibility;
I know not how
Say no more, Doña Clara,
Ah, señora,
Let us go to sleep now, señora,
My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,
What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?
Only one of your fair hands,
I should like to see that tried,
That we shall see presently,
What the devil fortress or castle is this,
Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?
I don’t know what you look like,
A castle it is,
It would be better if it were the other way,
You know but little of the world,
touch and no touch,
So be it,
It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,
That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,
What can you please or heaven order,
Don,
You shall not do that,
Our object,
Reason will compel your worship,
Let us hear what the whole affair is about,
Sinner that I am,
Give me leave, señora, to obtain the permission I speak of,
I hesitate,
Here, in the name of the king and justice!
You lie,
Egad, master,
Do as I bid thee,
There is no doubt of that,
What do you think now, gentlemen,
And whoever says the contrary,
saving better opinions and
that this piece we have now
Certainly not,
It is quite true,
God bless me!
To me it looks like a pack-saddle,
As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,
By God, gentlemen,
There can be no question,
May I never share heaven,
I say no more;
and here he rapped out a round oath
It might easily be a she-ass’s,
It is all the same,
You lie like a rascally clown,
For all that,
On, then, in God’s name,
If your worship is angry,
Say what thou wilt,
It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,
I swear by God Omnipotent,
True, no doubt,
So it is, I believe,
Believe it not,
as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddle
was heard to say, “O Knight of the
I don’t know what to think,
Catholic!
By God, master,
Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,
The Ill-advised Curiosity
Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,
The Ill-advised Curiosity
In God’s name, then, señor,
What Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,
Trim those lamps there!
I am not with child by anyone,
Or again,
It is as you say, señor canon,
I myself, at any rate,
‘No doubt,’ replied the actor in question, ‘you mean the “Isabella,
Phyllis,

The Numantia,
The Merchant Lover,
The Friendly Fair Foe,

what miracles they
And so it seems,
In that case,
Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son,
May Our Lady be good to me!
”
Leave off conjuring me,
That is what I want,
”
I tell thee I will not lie in any particular,
Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,
I do not understand ‘going anywhere,’
Is it possible,
Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho,
Aha, I have caught you,
that
What thou sayest is true, Sancho,
Still for all that,
I am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,
I will answer for his not running away,
And I also,
moreover
And
It is all exactly as you state it,
Just so,
Well then,
For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,
All that may be,
A good joke, that!
that these should be lies! And above all when
That, brother Sancho,
I don’t understand those philosophies,
That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,
That I can well believe,
At all events, señor,
I draw my stakes,
Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,
It is what we shall all do,
but why do I say the villages around,
a course that is worthy of
that
you
Leandra,
Leandra
Who should it be,
That,
You are a great scoundrel,
for he had no spurs
I will say it in one,
That I will do with all my heart, señor,
Thou art right, Sancho,
Thanks be to God,
I bring nothing of that sort, wife,
I am very glad of that,
I will show them to you at home, wife,
Heaven grant it, husband,
Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,
nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself
for so Sancho’s wife was called, though
Don’t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,
Forse altro cantera con miglior plettro.
No, not even in thought.
Then, brother,
Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,
I mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born
Does your worship think now, that it is
lurcher
This is a lurcher; ware!
The Perendenga,
Don Quixote
Persiles,
Galatea.
Mine, master shaver,
I don’t mean that,
Mine, however,
You take a long time to tell it, Señor Don Quixote,
I don’t choose to tell it here, now,
For my part,
an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the
I am not versed in stories,
Even if he were not,
And who will be security for you, señor curate?
My profession,
which is to keep secrets.
Ods body!
Alas!
So that’s the story, master barber,
mostly a tempestuous and stormy one
Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,
As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,
The señor curate has leave for more than that,
Well then, with that permission,
That is another mistake,
With regard to giants,
That is true,
As for Reinaldos,
That Angelica, señor curate,
Tell me, Señor Don Quixote,
I can well believe,
a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous hearts; but up
Strange,
May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,
It is not something to eat,
For all that,
I have no doubt of it,
God help them,
That is true,
I promise you,
That was only reasonable,
Thou art mistaken, Sancho,
I don’t understand any language but my own,
I mean to say,
It should be so,
Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,
That I will do with all my heart, master,
I will not be vexed at all,
Well then,
That,
Recollect, Sancho,
That’s just where it is, body of my father!
Is there more, then?
There’s the tail to be skinned yet,
I promise thee, Sancho,
What!
That is a Moorish name,
May be so,
which means in
Sancho,” observed Don Quixote.
Very likely,
Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,
Then I am off for him,
Cide;
So true is it, señor,
One of the things,
If it goes by good name and fame,
”
I never heard my lady Dulcinea called Doña,
That is not an objection of any importance,
Certainly not,
On that point,
Tell me, señor bachelor,
The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,
I cut no capers in the blanket,
There is no human history in the world, I suppose,
For all that,
That’s where the truth of the history comes in,
At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,
That is true,
Well then,
You are a sly dog, Sancho,
If I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,
Hush, Sancho,
And about me,
Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho,
What! Another word-catcher!
May God shorten mine, Sancho,
There is still sunshine on the wall,
By God, master,
Leave it to God, Sancho,
That is true,
I have seen governors in these parts,
Those are not governors of islands,
I could manage the gram well enough,
That would be working miracles,
Miracles or no miracles,
One of the faults they find with this history,
I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,
Then, I say,
No fear of that,
To write in any other way,
There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,
No doubt of that,
The reason of that,
That is no wonder,
All that is true, Señor Don Quixote,
That which treats of me must have pleased few,
Quite the contrary,
That is an easy matter,
Day came,
That is not where the mistake is,
I don’t know what to say to that,
No doubt that’s it,
I will take care,
Is there anything else to correct in the history, señor bachelor?
No doubt there is,
Does the author promise a second part at all?
He does promise one,
And what does the author mean to do?
What?
There’s where it is, what I abominate, Señor Samson,
Brother Sancho,
It is all the same, be it more or be it less,
Take care, Sancho,
That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,
God grant it,
Dulcinea del Toboso
Dulcinea del Toboso
It must be, by some means or other,
I don’t understand you, husband,
Hark ye, Teresa,
and he could do it at small cost by merely willing it
Look here, Sancho,
It is enough that God understands me, wife,
I know well enough, husband,
I can tell you, wife,
Nay, then, husband,
By my faith,
Nay, Sancho,
Tut, you fool,
Keep to your own station, Sancho,
Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,
Don’t you see, you animal,
Let us say no more about it,
Are you sure of all you say, husband?
I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!
Do you know why, husband?
Look here, Teresa,
Whence it arises,
I do not understand you, husband,

Resolved, you should say, woman,
not revolved.
Don’t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,

The day that I see her a countess,

God bless me!

There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,
and it is they that are the most numerous
Woe is me!
I can tell you, niece,
Nothing, Señor Samson,
Whereabouts is he breaking out, señora?
He is only breaking out at the door of his madness,
That I can well believe,
No, señor,
Well then,
Woe is me,
Induced, you should say, Sancho,
not educed.
Once or twice, as well as I remember,
”
I don’t understand thee, Sancho,
‘So focile’ means I am so much that way,
I understand thee still less now,
Well, if you can’t understand me,
Oh, now I have hit it,
I would bet,
May be so,
Teresa says,
And so say I,
The fact is,
All that is very true,
What I am driving at,
Sancho, my friend,
I see,
And so well understood,
I do deign,
Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!
blessed be Allah!
So I believe,
Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,
It might have been all that,
At all events, let us go there, Sancho,
Well, to tell the truth, señor,
What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,
So I say too,
That, Sancho,
All that your worship has said so far,
Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,
Tell me, señor,
where are they
The heathens,
Very good,
the tombs where the
That’s the point I’m coming to,
The answer is easy,
Now I have got you,
That I grant, too,
What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?
My meaning is,
All that is true,
Yes,
That,
The errants are many,
Many,
more or less
Body of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,
Señor,
Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,
Then let your worship lead the way,
So I see,
The curse of God on thee for a blockhead!
Señor,
and I wish I saw the dogs eating it for
Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,
I’ll hold my tongue,
Thou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,
I hear it now,
That cannot be,
Don’t mind that, señor,
Sancho, Sancho,

May I die, Sancho,
I do,
Señor,
Well, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,
May be so,
Sancho,
Go, my son,
I will go and return quickly,
Verily, Sancho,
for the author does not make
Your worship,
Then thou bringest good news,
So good,
Holy God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my friend?
What could I get by deceiving your worship,
in fact, like what she is. Her damsels and
Hackneys, you mean, Sancho,
There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,
Let us go, Sancho, my son,
I’ll take the foals,
How outside the city?
I see nothing, Sancho,
Now, may God deliver me from the devil!
or whatever they’re called
Well, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,
or jennyasses
Hush, señor,
Get up, Sancho,
Hey-day! My grandfather!

O scum of the earth!
Well, all I can say is there they were as plain as could be,
I believe it, my friend,
It was neither,
And that I could not see all this, Sancho!
THE CORTES OF DEATH
Melancholy, señor,
Hush, Sancho,
So say I,
Thou mayest well say that, Sancho,
Very likely,
Perhaps, Sancho,
I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,
By the faith of a knight-errant,
What devil?
The one with the bladders,
Then I will recover him,
You need not take the trouble, señor,
For all that,
Don’t think of it, your worship,
Still, for all that,
Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,
There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, señor,
Well,
At the same time, Sancho,
The sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,
were never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin.
That is true,
and, as a
I
Yes, I have seen that,
Well then,
A fine comparison!
Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,
Ay,
the
never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same

Brother Sancho, we have got an adventure.
God send us a good one,
Where, Sancho?
Well,
I do not mean to say,
Faith, you are right,
There is no knight-errant that is not,
Ah me!
Not so,
That he will,
Of the miserable,
Then come to me,
Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?
By mischance I am,
That is true,
I was never scorned by my lady,
Certainly not,
Is this your squire?
He is,
I never yet saw a squire,
By my faith then,
but never mind
So be it by all means,
It may be said, too,
All that,
I,
I,
Your master,
Well, then, you are wrong there,
in hunting
I am not in want of any of those things,
for dapple is the colour of my
In truth and earnest, sir squire,
I have two,
And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?
Fifteen, a couple of years more or less,
O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,
I do disown them,
There’s why they say that ‘covetousness bursts the bag,’
And is he in love perchance?
He is,
There’s no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrance in it,
Crazy but valiant,
Mine is not that,
For all that, brother and señor,
Why, what are you thinking about?
By my faith, brother,
There, you see,
how you have called this wine whoreson by way of praise.
Well,
O rare wine-taster!
Leave me alone for that,
Therefore, I say,
Until my master reaches Saragossa,
an unparalleled and awful
and bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in those
How! not vanquished?
Calm yourself, sir knight,
I am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,
That custom, sir squire,
I know a good remedy for that,
If that’s the way, so be it with all my heart,
That will not do,
Body of my father!
Still,
By no means,
I can remedy that entirely,
To match that plan,
though the surer way would be to let
Very good,
Well then,
To that we answer you,
That,
I am aware of it already,
That is understood,
It seems to me rather, Sancho,
To tell the truth,
It is,
who
Thy advice is not bad,
And the nose?
I have it here in my pocket,
Why, to be sure I am!
conditions which, in
I confess,
You must also confess and believe,
In that case,
That’s your affair,
And dost thou, then, believe, Sancho,
I don’t know what to say to that,
Let us reason the matter, Sancho,
Well, but what are we to say, señor,
It is all,
God knows what’s the truth of it all,
In truth,
You may safely hold in your mare, señor,
a figure and picture such as had not been seen in those regions
There is a good deal to be said on that point,
Why, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?
I doubt it,
Let me kiss,
I am no saint,
I, Señor Don Quixote,
May be so,
And are the lions large?
So large,
So, so,
Is your master then so mad,
He is not mad,
but he is venturesome.
I will prevent it,
Gentle sir,
O man of little faith,
Well, señor,
Fear at any rate,
I say
That I won’t,
That is true,
That will I give with all my heart,
What dost thou think of this, Sancho?
Then,
I protest, Señor Don Quixote,
I take the invitation as a great favour and honour, Señor Don Diego,
The Knight of the Green Gaban.
I don’t know what to say, my son,
A poet, it may be,
I do not dislike that modesty,
There is no rule without an exception,
Very few,
So far,
That of knight-errantry,
I do not know what science that is,
It is a science,
If that be so,
How, if that be so?
What I mean to say,
Many a time,
Our guest has broken out on our hands,
A discerning friend of mine,
Verily, Señor Don Quixote,
I don’t understand what you say, or mean by slipping,
I will explain myself another time,

as a certain poet, God forgive him, said
that Phœbus may pierce them with his
Blessed be God,
Not at all,
For that excellence alone,
Say that to my wife,
I meant to say the opposite
If all those who love one another were to marry,
God will guide it better,
What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!
Oh, if you don’t understand me,
Cavilling, not gravelling,
Don’t find fault with me, your worship,
That is true,
Look here, bachelor Corchuelo,
It is no idea on my part, but an established truth,
As to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,
We shall soon see,
It must not be that way,
I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,
Have done, thou glutton,
Let him do what he likes,
For God’s sake, Sancho,
If your worship had a good memory,
I remember no such article, Sancho,
I don’t see one,
Wait a bit,
I have nothing to put them in,
Well then,
As yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,
we are all safe and sound;
speaking dances.
Poetry
Wit
Birth
Valour
Liberality,
Largess,
Treasure,
Peaceful Possession.
Castle of Caution.
I will lay a wager,
It is easy to see thou art a clown, Sancho,
and one of that sort that cry ‘Long life to the conqueror.’
I don’t know of what sort I am,
Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?
God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,
At the rate we are going,
Even should that happen, O Sancho,
In good faith, señor,
Say no more, Sancho,
He preaches well who lives well,
Nor needst thou,
Pass judgment on your chivalries, señor,
by my oath, but
jet rings on them! May I never have luck
and her shape! Wouldn’t you say she was like a walking palm
In this case,
Yes, I give it,
And I give myself to be thy wife,
For one so badly wounded,
Hold, sirs, hold!
That,
Remember, O prudent Basilio,
What art thou muttering there, Sancho?
I’m not saying anything or muttering anything,
Is thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?
She is not very bad,
Thou dost wrong, Sancho,
We are quits,
The Book of Liveries,
for,
and God give you luck in printing your books
So it must,
So I think,
Really, brother,
Look here, señor,
You are right, friend,
Hold your peace, señor,
Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,
Tie me and hold thy peace,
The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,
Hell do you call it?
Let no one rise, and attend to me, my sons, both of you.
That poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,
I do not know,
That is true,
And with no less do I tell the tale,
the venerable Montesinos led me into the palace of crystal,
Still I wonder,
Nay, Sancho, my friend,
I cannot understand, Señor Don Quixote,
How long is it since I went down?
Little better than an hour,
That cannot be,
My master must be right,
That’s it,
And did your worship eat anything all that time, señor?
I never touched a morsel,
And do the enchanted eat?
They neither eat,
And do the enchanted sleep, now, señor?
Certainly not,
I was just going to say the devil
What!
I don’t believe my master lies,
If not, what dost thou believe?
I believe,
All that might be, Sancho,
As I know thee, Sancho,
I heed not thy words.
Nor I your worship’s,
I recognised her,
O blessed God!
Thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,
You are right,
which I doubt
There are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can be dedicated,
Not many,
how much
Not far from this,
Has this hermit any hens, do you think?
Few hermits are without them,
I cannot stop, señor,
If I found any in water,

How poverty?
the heat one can understand.
Señor,
And did you get any bounty, now?
And tell me, for heaven’s sake,
They gave me two,
What spilorceria!—as an Italian would say,
Don’t wait for that,
I’ll help you in everything,
Ods body!
They are close at hand,
So be it by all means,
a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but
Gad,
That I can well believe,
Now I declare,
If I had money,
If the packet is express from the devil,
Thou dost not understand me, Sancho,
Still,
That may be,
Did I not say, señor,
The course of events will tell, Sancho,
Something!

I will,


and that they
Nay, nay,
True enough,

Let it live, and welcome,

Now am I fully convinced,
Proceed,
Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,
It’s not little,
Nor is it much,
Let him have the whole five and a quarter,
For this figure,
The very devil must be in it,
Let him have them, Sancho,
No one could tell us that better than my ape,
I swear as a Catholic Christian;
as no doubt he was

or the
The devil take me,
I’m not equal to answering,
He does not fly who retires,
The cause of that soreness,
By God,
I would lay a good wager with you, Sancho,
I own, Sancho,
I think,
Very good,
O body o’ me!
Well, how long is it, Sancho, since I promised it to you?
If I remember rightly,
for such I take thee to be
I should have been surprised, Sancho,
As that’s the case,
I don’t know if I may call them absurdities
I don’t understand that logiquous,
Longinquous,
Now they are tied,
what are we to do next?
What?
And when we come to that line your worship speaks of,
how far shall we have gone?
Very far,
By God,
computed,
I don’t believe a bit of it,
Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,
Why, how so?
hast thou come upon aught?
Ay, and aughts,
Hold thy peace, Sancho,
Did I not tell thee, Sancho,
That’s enough,
You’ve got a likely one here to thrust any in!
Except that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea,
I know not that thou hast carried any other, at least in my service.
That is true,
That I believe, Sancho,
You have indeed, squire,
Tell me, brother squire,
He is the same, señora,
I am rejoiced at all this,
That which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,
Gently, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha,
And talkative,
So much the better,

I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,
Well then,
Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,
I have so considered and reconsidered,
It would be well,
Discreet be the days of your holiness,
him there was that quarrel about
Isn’t all this true, master mine?
So far,
Thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,
He is not to cut it short,
Well then, sirs, I say,

Get on, brother,
I’ll stop less than half-way, please God,
rest his soul, he is now dead; and more by token he died

As you live, my son,
Well then, it so happened,
and I think I can see them now plainer

So, as I was saying,
I don’t know,
Have you seen her enchanted, Sancho?
What, seen her!
But the reply deserves a
Good, by God!
Perhaps, brother,
Yes, I am,
‘Attach thyself to the good, and
No, Sancho my friend, certainly not,
Go down on thy knees, Sancho,
That is true,
I will take my oath of that,
What are you saying to yourself, Sancho?
I was saying, señora,
Don’t be uneasy, friend Sancho,
I’ll be content with the beard,
Attend to worthy Sancho’s request, seneschal,
What does Demosthenian mean, Señor Don Quixote?
Demosthenian eloquence,
True,
I would do so certainly,
God bless me!
Who?
that accursed race
There is no denying it,
There is a good deal to be said on that point,
That is true,
To that I may reply,
I protest, Señor Don Quixote,
What is all this, brothers?
Yes, I will,
It is easy to see, Sancho,
or cirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be the fortunes
By God, señora,
good night to us. And I say once more, if your ladyship
To be sure they don’t lie!
As to governing them well,
You are right, Sancho,
All that’s very possible,
That is true,
So I say,
‘Sancho said it, Sancho did it, Sancho
All worthy Sancho’s observations,
Indeed, señora,
So I believe,
What is Dapple?
My ass,
He must have been some clown,
That will do,
It will be enough for him to be in the stable,
Take him to your government, Sancho,
Don’t think, señora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,
That,
Just so,
Quite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,
Nay,
God grant it may turn out so,
Be that as it may,
The curse of God and all his saints upon thee, thou accursed Sancho!
as I have often said to
when I shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remark
may God grant as much health to him, or to me if I want to listen to
Sancho Panza’s proverbs,
Ho there! brother courier,
If you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,
By God and upon my conscience,
This demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,
Why not?
I am the sage Lirgandeo,
Nor where there are lights and it is bright,
That remains to be seen,

By all that’s good,
But I’ll take you, Don Clown stuffed with garlic,

Well then, the fact is, friend Sancho,

No, certainly not,
Now then, Sancho!

though I can’t see it myself
There will be no need to let you know of any over,
Well then, in God’s hands be it,
That,
So be it by all means,
And who dictated it?
Who should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?
And did you write it yourself?
That I didn’t,
Let us see it,
that
I don’t mean it that way, señora,
No, no,
I wish, señor duke,
for in my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it’s
Hush, friend Sancho,
For all that,
These squires,
I have no doubt,
In respect of her being a countess,
Who bade thee meddle in this, Sancho?
Who, señor?
Sancho is right,
He would be wanting in wits, señora countess,
The Panza is here,
and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when
Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,
I will,
She died, no doubt,
Of course,
Señor Squire,

Thou art right, Sancho,
The bitter is indeed to come,

That is the truth, señor,
I will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,
if I don’t cure yours.
There shall be no delay on my part,
The fact is,
For going smoothly and easily,
And how many is there room for on this horse?
Two,
I’d like to know, Señora Distressed One,
His name,
I’ll bet,
That is true,
I have nothing to say against his name,
I have said already,
I’d like to see him,
Yes, you can, my friend,
In the king’s name!
For all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,
In the king’s name, once more!
You are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,
Your excellence may say it if you like,
Well, Señora Rodriguez, Señora Trifaldi, and present company,
Ah!
And let the squire, if he has one,
That I will, Señora Countess Trifaldi,
That I won’t,
Friend Sancho,
Say no more, señor,
Well then,
Since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills,
By God,
Well, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,
I’m not voracious,
Let us be off, señor,
That is true,
There is no occasion,
Blindfold me,
Don’t mind that, Sancho,
That’s true,
Do nothing of the kind,
I don’t know how that may be,
That is true,
Take care, Sancho,
I don’t understand that way of looking at things,
which are like
for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileño
And while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,
how did Señor Don Quixote amuse himself?
I am neither lying nor dreaming,
Tell us them then, Sancho,
Two of them,
An odd sort of goat, that,
That’s very plain,
Tell me, Sancho,
No, señor,
Recollect, Sancho,
Well then,
If you once make trial of it, Sancho,
Señor,
May I be buried with you, Sancho,
Let them dress me as they like,
That’s true,
Of letters I know but little,
With so good a memory,
That’s the truth,
True,
a thing which may happen
a filthy and unnatural abuse.
Eruct!
I don’t know what that means.
To eruct, Sancho,
In truth, señor,
Eruct, Sancho, not belch,
Eruct, I shall say henceforth, and I swear not to forget it,
Likewise, Sancho,
God alone can cure that,
That’s it, Sancho!

Señor,
I don’t and can’t recollect any more of it than of last

By God, master mine,

What can be better,

It is no joke, señor,
Thou wilt do well, Sancho,
The truth is, señora,

And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?
Your lordship,
Well then, let me tell you, brother,
What say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?
Willingly,
here it is señor,
I, señor!
Yes,
It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not,
And did he take it?
Take it!
She is right,
as I supposed, and
that I wanted to steal some of the cloth, led to think
Is all this true, brother?
Yes,
With all my heart,
I know not from what,
Well then,
Why so?
Because,
In that case,
Your worship is right, señor governor,

_Absit_,

Which of you is my secretary?
With that addition,

No, my lord,
There is nothing to be afraid of,
Would it be possible, carver,
To-night at supper,
God grant it,
Which is the lord governor here?
Which should it be,
Then I humble myself before him,
Another Tirteafuera!
The case is this, señor,
No, señor, certainly not,
We’ve got that much settled,
Well then,
let my lord
Paint what you will,
That I have still to furnish,
That will do, brother,
I want your worship, señor,
Is there anything else you want, good man?
There’s another thing I’d like,
Just see if there’s anything else you’d like,
No, indeed there is not,
No,
Jesus! what’s this I see?
if so be you are indeed Don Quixote
Tell me, Señora Doña Rodriguez,
I carry nobody’s messages, señor,

Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?
Of you and against you I ask it,

for that was my mistress’s name. Still my husband, cap in

Of a truth, señor governor,
That I believe,
There is so much in what your worship says, señor governor,
Be calm, my good man,
What say you to this?
That is true,
What is to be done,
This one at least,
What did you run for, fellow?
What are you by trade?
A weaver.
And what do you weave?
Lance heads, with your worship’s good leave.
To take the air, señor.
And where does one take the air in this island?
Where it blows.
By God,
Why shan’t I make thee sleep in gaol?
All the power your worship has,
How? not able!
That’s ridiculous,
Tell me, you devil,
Now, señor governor,
No, truly,
and the fellow has made his point.
So then,
No, señor,
certainly not.
Well then, go, and God be with you,
That won’t do, señora,
I had already noticed that,
I am confused just now, sirs,
Ay, that will do,
It is true,
The fact is, sirs,
O that I had

Proceed, señora,
I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,
for ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.
So then, señora,
Nothing has happened me,
That is true,
No harm has been done,
Well then, miss,
That I will with all my heart, señor,
Well,
they to her shame had cut it short
What’s this, child? What gentleman is this?
A servant of my lady, Doña Teresa Panza,
Ah, señor, get up, do that,
You are,
That is the truth,
Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?
Nor I either,
There is no need to fetch anybody,
Your husband Sancho’s good qualities, of heart as well
Ah, what a good, plain, lowly lady!
and equal may I see her with the tallest church-tower in
That I will, mother,
It is all for thee, my child,
You will be glad too,
May he live a thousand years,
What’s all this, Teresa Panza,
The madness is only this,
God help us,
There, you may see it yourselves,
Square that if you can,
I have not noticed,
but no doubt he wears them.
Ah! my God!
As things go you will see that if you live,
And why not, mother!
To be sure you do, my child,
Here, here!
And what do I care,
That is true,
All I know, sirs,
It may be so,
but _dubitat Augustinus_.
Doubt who will,
It’s for me to make that trip,
Governors’ daughters,
By God,
Hush, girl,
Señora Teresa says more than she is aware of,
Come and do penance with me,
will your worship please to pay attention, for the
It is as the señor governor says,
Well then I say,
But then, señor governor,
Look here, my good sir,
That is true,
That’s all I ask for—fair play,
God
There is no necessity,
Then with that assurance and your highness’s good leave,
I do so place it,
And I too,
to Rome for everything.
What have I to do with arming?
Ah, señor governor,
Arm me then, in God’s name,
How am I to march, unlucky being that I am?
On, señor governor!
Lift me up,
That is unnecessary, señor governor,
You spoke late,
No one can demand it of me,
By God the great Sancho is right,
alms,
Geld! Geld!
I don’t understand what you want of me, good people,
If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,
very small ones of

and nothing gave him pain;
Español y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compaño;
Bon compaño, jur a Di!
That may be,
I would do it,
And what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?
I have given up being governor of an island,
And where is this island?
Where?
Nonsense! Sancho,
What? No islands!
And what hast thou gained by the government?
I have gained,
I don’t understand thee, Sancho,
And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,
I will not press thee, Sancho,
I was so,
God grant it,
God be with thee, brother Sancho,
Alas,
With bread all sorrows are less.
God Almighty help me!
Who should be here, or who should complain,
In that case,
Don Quixote I am,
By all that’s good,
Famous testimony!
Go, your worship,
I won’t drink of this water;
Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,
They’ll be pretty sure this time,
Just so,
Well then,
It is, señor,
And he does well,
Do not distress yourselves, ladies,
Oh, señor,
and that’s no
‘naked I was born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor
God forbid,
And may God so prosper it, Señor Don Quixote,
One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,
Didn’t I say so?
For all your worship says,
Señor,
With your good leave,
I should think they were!
It was not that, most likely,
This,
May God hear and sin be deaf,
Thou sayest well, Sancho,
I can well believe it,
Thou art very simple, Sancho,
Bear in mind, Sancho,
Notable cruelty!
Recollect, Sancho,
or at least
Ah! friend of my soul,
That’s true,
Oh, my friend,
And justly awarded,
some will say
but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell is
Rabble!
Eat, Sancho my friend,
So then,
There is a good deal to be said on that point,
There’s no need of all that,
Well then,
Pullet! My father!
In that case,
you will not be without veal or kid.
Just now,
Much good that does us,
By God,
Body o’ me!
In truth and earnest, señor guest,
I mark them for mine on the spot,
Nobody shall touch them,
If you come to people of quality,
For all that,
Who is this that answers us?
Who should it be,
A nice sort of historian, indeed!
From your talk, friend,
Yes, I am,
and I’m proud of it.
Faith, then,
God forgive him,
But he does,
Believe me,
I believe it,
Let him who will paint me,
None can be offered to Señor Don Quixote,
For that very reason,
You will do quite right,
That is what I mean to do,
And me too,
maybe I’ll be good for something.
It is I,
Not a bit of it,
It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,
for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;
How now, traitor!
I neither put down king, nor set up king,

The cause of my dejection,
Nobody need have any doubt about that,
It is not true, then,
Assuredly not,
What are you talking about, man?
That is true,
The sort we are after,
Well then, away with you all,
Señor,
So then,
though at
all seemed to fill the whole
No, señor, that’s not true,
Indeed,
What!
has Sancho been a governor?
Ay,
I swear it,
In reliance upon that promise,
True, Señor Don Quixote,
Go your own way, brother,
By God, your worship is right,
I cannot judge of thoughts.
How many of us are here?
Tell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?
Be very modest.
I question thee no further,
Think how he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;
Thou knowest,
That is not what I ask thee,
but to tell me if thou knowest me.
I do not seek to know more,
I have said already,
That’s ‘what I see with my eyes I point out with my finger,’
so I ask no more.
As to the question of the cave,
I seek to know no more,
Good, by God!
What answer wouldst thou have, beast?
Yes, it is enough,
Books printed here,
Señor, this gentleman here
What is the title of the book?
Señor, in Italian the book is called _Le Bagatelle_.
And what does _Le Bagatelle_ import in our Spanish?
_Le Bagatelle_,
I,
I
have
Yes, often,
And how do you render that in Spanish?
How should I render it,
but by _olla_?
Body o’ me,
I translate them so of course,
I would venture to swear,
I print at my own risk,
A fine calculation you are making!
What!
God send your worship good luck,
Light of the Soul;

No more of that, señor,
Nay,
At any rate,
Here Troy was,
Señor,
Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,
Señor,
Thou sayest well, Sancho,
That’s the very thing,
And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,
Your worship is right,
That I will, certainly,
Well, here it is, worthy sir,
Not at all,
Answer in God’s name, Sancho my friend,
By all that’s good,
The best plan will be for them not to run,

only to read and read, and have interest
I do not recognise you, friend,
I am Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, Señor Don Quixote,

Nonsense, good sir!

Ought!

The thoughts that I had,
Look ye, Sancho,

Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,

That’s no wonder,
Very likely,
Second Part of the History of Don Quixote of La Mancha,
A vision it must have been, no doubt,
That I can well believe,

Will your worship tell me who you are,
so that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?
Of a truth,
Don’t be surprised at that,
And mine,
Ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,
Thou art right, Sancho my friend,

O blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!
When?
‘Pledges don’t distress a good payer,’
Go on, Sancho my friend, and be not disheartened,
for I double the stakes as to price.
In that case,
No, no, señor,
As thou art in such a willing mood,
Here dies Samson, and all with him!
As your worship will have it so, señor,
I’ll lay a bet,
Thou art right, Sancho,
Egad, señor,
And yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,
praying to God and plying the hammer,
one take was better than two I’ll give thee’s,
For God’s sake, Sancho, no more proverbs!
I don’t know what bad luck it is of mine,
Very likely,
In what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?
To a village near this which is my own village,
and your worship, where are you bound for?
I am going to Granada, señor,
And a goodly country,
My name is Don Álvaro Tarfe,
I am the same,
Tell me, Señor Don Álvaro,
No indeed,
not a bit.
And that Don Quixote—
He had,
That I can well believe,
By God I believe it,
I don’t know whether I am good,
That I will do most willingly,
No doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,
I don’t understand that about the lashes,

Well,
what does it matter if the boy said so?
What!
Your worship’s a strange man,
Hold your tongue, Teresa,
You bring the money, my good husband,
And what’s more,
That’s the very thing,
Very true,
And,
And,
